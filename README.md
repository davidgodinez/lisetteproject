# Lisette's Project

It is an autonomous photographer that has a small cart at it's base that can navigate via neural networks. The box houses a stand that can adjust it's height based on the user's height, etc.

## Major Components

- The self-driving cart
- The stand which can adjust itself based on lighting, etc.
- Possibly a camera atop the stand to adjust for lighting, and other factors in photography.
